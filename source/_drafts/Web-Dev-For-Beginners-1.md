## Programming
Programming (also known as coding) is the process of writing instructions to a device, such as a computer or mobile device. We write these instructions with a programming language, which is then interpreted by the device. 

## Programming languages
Programming languages serve a main purpose: for developers to build instructions to send to a device. Devices only can understand binary (1s and 0s), and for most developers that's not a very efficient way to communicate. Programming languages are a vehicle for communication between humans and computers.
